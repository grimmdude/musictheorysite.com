<p class="intro">A pentatonic scale, as the name implies, has only five notes and is based on either the major or minor scale.  Pentatonic scales are great start for song writing and improvising.</p>

	<h3>Major Pentatonic Scale:</h3>
	<p>In this tutorial instead of using note names I'll refer to scale degree numbers 1-7 of the major and minor scales. This makes it easy to transpose the scale into different keys and gives you a much wider view for learning.</p>
	<p>The major pentatonic scale is scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 of the regular major scale.  You'll notice that it's a major scale without degees 4 and 7.  When you remove degrees 4 and 7 from the major scale there are no more half steps; for this reason pretty much any note in the major pentatonic scale sounds good over a major chord progression.</p>
	<p>Since I'm a sucker for examples let's throw a few out there.  In these written examples you can see the gaps where note degrees 4 &amp; 7 are omitted for the major pentatonic scale.</p>
	<h4>C major pentatonic scale:</h4>
	<p>Notes: C - D - E - G - A</p>
	<div class="vex-tabdiv" width=680 scale=1.0 editor="false">options space=20
		stave
		notation=true
		key=C time=5/4

		notes C-D-E-G-A/5
		options space=25
	</div>

		<h4>G major pentatonic scale:</h4>
	<p>Notes: G - A - B - D - E</p>
	<div class="vex-tabdiv" width=680 scale=1.0 editor="false">options space=20
		stave
		notation=true
		key=G time=5/4

		notes G-A-B/4 D-E/5
		options space=25
	</div>

		<h4>Eb Major Pentatonic Scale</h4>
	<p>Notes: Eb - F - G - Bb - C</p>
	<div class="vex-tabdiv" width=680 scale=1.0 editor="false">options space=20
		stave
		notation=true
		key=Eb time=5/4

		notes E-F-G-B/4 C/5
		options space=25
	</div>

		<h3>Minor Pentatonic Scale:</h3>
	<p>The minor pentatonic scale is 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 of the natural minor scale. That is, a natural minor scale without degrees 2 and 6. Sometimes it's easier to think of a major pentatonic scale that starts and ends on degree 6.</p>
	<h4>E minor pentatonic scale:</h4>
	<p>Notes: E - G- A - B - D</p>
	<div class="vex-tabdiv" width=680 scale=1.0 editor="false">options space=20
		stave
		notation=true
		key=G time=5/4

		notes E-G-A-B/4 D/5
		options space=25
	</div>
	<p>If you haven't already learned about <a title="Relative Minor" href="/minor-scales/#relative_minor">relative keys</a> now would be the time to check them out.  Understanding them can really speed up your  learning of scales.  Since there are twelve major pentatonic scales and twelve minor pentatonic scales you might be a little overwhelmed with trying to learn them all separately.  However, understanding relative keys will cut those 24 scales in half so that once you learn twelve you've learned them all.</p>
	<p>Do yourself a favor and read about relative keys!</p>
