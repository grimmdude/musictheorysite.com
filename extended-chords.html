<p class="intro">Extended chords are simply chords that have notes which extend further than the standard three note triad.  They're  formed by stacking thirds on top of the base triad.</p>

<p>Extended chords provide another layer of sound above general major and minor <a title="Triads" href="/triads/">triads</a>.  They can add that extra spice that a song needs or can be that mystery chord that you can't quite figure out when learning a song by ear.  The &#8216;extended' portion of the chords is the extra thirds that are stacked above a base triad, which is formed by the 1st, 3rd, and 5th degrees of the scale .  Here are the types of extended chords I'll be cover in this tutorial:</p>

<h3 id="7_chords">7th Chords</h3>
<p>To make a seventh chord you start with the base triad and add the 7th scale degree on top.  Whether that added third is major or minor is dependent on the type of 7th chord.  Here are the three types of 7th chords I'll be showing you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major 7 (M7)</li>
<li>Minor 7 (m7)</li>
<li>Dominant 7 (7)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Major 7th Chords:</h4>
<p>The major 7th chord is a major triad with a major third stacked on the top.  The sound of the major 7 chord is open and airy, it's used very regularly in jazz.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>C major 7 chord (CM7)</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13486" title="CM7 Chord" src="/assets/img/Cmajor7_chord.jpg" alt="" width="213" height="78" /></p>
<p>Notes: C - E - G - B</p></blockquote>
<h4>When do they work?</h4>
<p>Major 7th chords occur <a title="Diatonic Chords in a Major Key" href="/major-diatonic-chords/">diatonically</a> as the IM7 &amp; IVM7 in major keys and IIIM7 &amp; VIM7 in minor keys.</p>
<h4>Minor 7th Chords:</h4>
<p>To construct a minor 7 chord take a minor triad and add another minor third on top.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>C minor 7 chord (Cm7)</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13487" title="Cm7 Chord" src="/assets/img/Cminor7chord.jpg" alt="" width="222" height="84" /></p>
<p>Notes: C - Eb - G - Bb</p></blockquote>
<h4>When do they work?</h4>
<p>The minor 7 chord occurs diatonically as a iim7, iiim7, &amp; vim7 in a major key and im7, ivm7,  &amp; vm7 in a minor key.  Basically, any diatonic minor chord could also be played as a minor 7 chord and still sound right.</p>
<h4 id="dominant_7_chords">Dominant 7th Chords:</h4>
<p>The dominant 7th chord is a major triad with a minor third stacked on top of it. It's natural tendency is to resolve a fourth down.  It's used a lot in blues and jazz</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>C Dominant 7 Chord (C7)</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13488" title="C7 Chord" src="/assets/img/C7chord.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="84" /></p></blockquote>
<h4 id="9_chords">When do they work?</h4>
<p>Dominant 7th chords occur diatonically as a V7 in all major keys and can be played non-diatonically as a V7 in minor keys.  The V chord is also called the dominant chord, which is where the <a title="Diatonic Chord Progressions - Chord Functions" href="/creating-diatonic-chord-progressions#chord_functions">dominant</a> 7th gets it's name.</p>
