<p class="intro">The function of sharps and flats is to raise or lower a note by a half, or even a full, step.  They define key signatures and appear in 'one-shot' versions called accidentals next to notes on the staff.</p>

<h3 id="sharp">Sharp</h3>
<p>A sharp is a hash mark symbol (<span class="accidental sharp"></span>) you'll find in a <a title="Key Signatures" href="/key-signatures">key signature</a> or as an accidental next to a note.  They're used to raise a specified note by one <a title="Intervals" href="/intervals">half step</a> and are always written on the line or space of the note they alter.</p>
<p>In this example the F note has a sharp next to it making it an F<span class="accidental sharp"></span>.  When a sharp, flat, or natural sign is placed directly next to a note it's called an accidental.</p>

<h4 id="double_sharp">Double Sharp</h4>
<p>In addition to sharps there exists a greater beast that does the job of two sharps at the same time; it's called a double sharp.  The double sharp raises a note one whole step and it looks like a mix between an 'x' and a star.  Normal sharps are used in <a title="Key Signatures" href="http://www.musictheorysite.com/key-signatures/">key signatures</a> <em>and</em> as accidentals, but double sharps are mainly used as accidentals only.</p>
<p>We may be getting a little ahead of ourselves here, but a common use of a double sharp is in <a title="Minor Scales" href="/minor-scales#melodic_minor">melodic minor</a> melodies.  In minor keys where the 7th note is naturally sharp, another sharp is needed to raise the note a half step higher in order to achieve the leading tone or construct a major V chord.  In this case we replace the normal sharp with a double sharp.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what a double sharp looks like and how to use it to raise the 7th in the key of G<span class="accidental sharp"></span> minor:</p>

<h3 id="flat">Flat</h3>
<p>A flat is just the opposite of a sharp; it lowers a specified note by one half step.  You can identify them by their resemblance to a lowercase b; they look like this: <span class="accidental flat"></span>.  Like sharps they're also used in key signatures and as accidentals and abide by the same guidelines when written; ie always on the line or space of the note they affect.</p>
<p>In this example the song is in G major, according to the key signature, but the flats are acting as accidentals to transform the B notes into B<span class="accidental flat"></span>.</p>

<h4>Double Flat</h4>
<p>The double flat, as it's name implies, is a flat x2.  It's essentially a mirror image of a double sharp; instead of raising a note by a whole step it <em>lowers</em> it by a whole step.  A double flat is written simply as two flats side by side.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a double flat by way of an interesting sounding chord progression in D<span class="accidental flat"> major; I &#8211; IV &#8211; iv &#8211; I.  When it comes to lowering the 3rd in the iv chord a double flat needs to be used since the note is already flat according to the key signature.</p>
