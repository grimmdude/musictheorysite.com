<p class="intro">A scale is simply a group of notes in succession. There are many different types of scales but by far the two most common are the major and minor scales. Here I&#8217;ll be explaining how a major scale is constructed and how to use this information to figure out the major scale for any key.</p>

<h3>How They&#8217;re Constructed</h3>
<p>There are only twelve pitches in standard western music. After twelve, the pitches repeat but in the next higher register or &#8220;octave&#8221;.  Once you understand the concept of <a title="Intervals" href="../intervals/">intervals</a>, scales will be pretty easy to grasp since they&#8217;re just made of a series of intervals.</p>
<p>You can figure out scales in any key by knowing the interval &#8216;formula&#8217; for the type of scale you&#8217;re looking for.  For clarity, lets say <strong>W=whole step</strong> and <strong>H=half step</strong>.  Remember, a half step is the smallest interval there is and, on a piano, will be just one key away from the starting note.  A whole step is made of two half steps so it will be two keys away from the starting note.  Be sure to include the black keys when counting steps.</p>
<p>Here is the scale &#8216;formula&#8217; for the major scale:</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>Major scale formula</h5>
<p>W - W - H - W - W - W - H</p></blockquote>
<p>Using this formula, say we wanted to figure out the C major scale. First start with the root note, C, and follow the formula:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>whole</strong> step from C is D.</li>
<li>A <strong>whole</strong> step from D is E.</li>
<li>A <strong>half step</strong> from E is F.</li>
<li>A <strong>whole step</strong> from F is G.</li>
<li>A <strong>whole step</strong> from G is A.</li>
<li>A <strong>whole step</strong> from A is B.</li>
<li>A<strong> half step</strong> from B is C, back to the top.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the C major scale ends up looking like this:</p>

<h3>Writing Major Scales in Any Key</h3>
<p>The above &#8216;major scale formula&#8217; is all you need to write a major scale in any key.  Let&#8217;s try to write the major scale for other keys.</p>
<p>How about a &#8216;hard&#8217; key to mix it up; F#:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>whole</strong> step from F# is G#</li>
<li>A <strong>whole</strong> step from G# is A#</li>
<li>A <strong>half step</strong> from A# is B</li>
<li>A <strong>whole step</strong> from B is C#</li>
<li>A <strong>whole step</strong> from C# is D#</li>
<li>A <strong>whole step</strong> from D# is E#</li>
<li>A <strong>half step</strong> from E# is F#, and we&#8217;re back at the top.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h5>F# Major Scale</h5>
<p>F# - G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E#</p></blockquote>
<p>One more for good measure.  Let&#8217;s figure out the notes for the Bb major scale.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>whole</strong> step from Bb is C</li>
<li>A <strong>whole</strong> step from C is D</li>
<li>A <strong>half step</strong> from D is Eb</li>
<li>A <strong>whole step</strong> from Eb is F</li>
<li>A <strong>whole step</strong> from F is G</li>
<li>A <strong>whole step</strong> from G is A</li>
<li>A <strong>half step</strong> from A is Bb, and we&#8217;re back at the top.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h5>Bb Major Scale</h5>
<p>Bb - C - D - Eb - F - G - A</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that you can build major scales you&#8217;ll want to commit them to memory for best results down the road.  To help with that I&#8217;ve created a <a title="List of All Major Scales" href="http://www.musictheorysite.com/major-scales/list-of-all-major-scales/">complete list of all major scales</a> for your reference.  Also, to understand the relationship of each key to the next, be sure to get yourself familiarized with the <a title="The Circle of Fifths" href="http://www.musictheorysite.com/the-circle-of-fifths/">circle of fifths</a>.</p>
